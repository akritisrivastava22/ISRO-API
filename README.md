This is a simple project that displays information from ISRO 

I have used basic languages like-  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It consists  4 Main Pages: home, spacecrafts, launchers, and centers. 

Every page reflects data from the from a specific API.
 The design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using media queries.
